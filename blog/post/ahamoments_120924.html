          <h2>SIMPLICITY</h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>Ok, so I'll share three of the most memorable and important "aha!" moments of my career, ranked, but not in order.</b>
            <br><br>
            The first is when I first started affiliate marketing. I had made 2 copies of the same site, something I often did, and was promoting a product aimed at more elderly folk. That'll be a key part later on.
            <br><br>
            I had finished templating the first site with a theme I'd bought, called "Sleek". It was modern, shiny, professional looking. When I was done, I was exhausted and decided to take a break. I'd end up taking a very long nap (universally known by parents as teenage hiberation), and only got back to work on the second site days later.
            <br><br>
            Both the sites were already live and had been pre-backlink flooded before I started working on the first one.
            <br><br>
            So when I got back to it, both were ranking in the top 3, yet when I checked my backoffice, the one I hadn't worked on yet, was outperforming the "Sleek" one, sales-wise. It was all organic because I wasn't advertising at all. Only SEO.
            <br><br>
            The one I had barely worked on had basic CSS formatting, with sections and paragraphs, title text and so on. Nothing else. It was black text on white background (with a tonne of white-text keywords spammed at the bottom, of course, so the crawler bots saw it, but not the human eye).
            <br><br>
            For a while I wondered why it was so? How could a basic, unpolished site outperform a sleek, professional-looking one? I didn't worry too long-because, well, results! The content was exactly the same on both sites though. Not a single word did I change.
            <br><br>
            Yet, it bugged me. I realised it was likely the audience who were ending up on the site <i>-the target audience-</i> found it less sale-sy. These were older, more traditional buyers. The polished look screamed "corporate sales pitch", while the simpler site felt like someone real was behind it. Thus it appeared to be more trustworthy. Little did <i>they</i> know...
            <br><br>
            I tested this out with other similar products aimed at the older generation, and it held true. Not always, but reliably enough that I could replicate it with consistency. The reverse was also true, to a lesser degree.
            <br><br>
            It was my first official glipse into understanding your audience, and tailoring your message, aesthetics, and product to appeal to them. These days, we have dynamic customisations, based on various factors, including data shared with the site through your browser or device. It's helpful, and takes some of the guesswork out, although it absolutely doesn't mean foregoing research, or testing hypotheses.
          </p>

        <div class="section-title">
          <h2>PERSPECTIVE</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            The third (we'll get to 2, they are similar), is when I was working on display ads for a real estate conglomerate. I had noticed that the Click Through Rates of my 2nd ranked display ads were outperforming the top placed ad. That was curious. Top position wins the majority of clicks, because it gets the lion share of eyeballs.
            <br><br>
            Digging into it, I went on the top listing sites we were advertising on and saw that the 2nd position ads looked more like the organic listings. The top position ads tended to stand out, and look like ads.
            <br><br>
            I made a decision to test my hunch by lowering my bids on a bunch of ads. It turned out to work, and the volume of clicks improved further. Subsequently, so did the number of leads. Surprisingly, the conversion rate didn't decrease too much given the over 25 percentage point increase in click volume. In any case, I followed up by lowering the bids of even more campaigns, achieving similar results.
            <br><br>
            In the end I was playing a rather fun game of balancing the ball, trying to maintain second spot. Normally, and especially in a competetive niche like real estate, we're fighting tooth and nail for top spot, doing everything we can. Impression share! Outranking share! Quality Score! Day Parting! Bid Higher!
            <br><br>
            Here I was trying my very hardest not to be top spot. <i>What fun!</i>
            <br><br>
            It pays to know the layout of the sites your ads are getting placements on. And it really pays to know how to manipulate the game, so you aren't simply chasing the carrot on a stick, or mindlessly aiming for the shiny top spot. The real win was unlocking a different perspective on ad placements, and proving that second place isnâ€™t always second best.
            <br><br>
            By the end of the campaign, the client we were working for was so thrilled they gave us the entire account. I got a pen.

          <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            And finally the second. I once worked at a dating agency. I was in charge of bringing in leads. <i>If</i> they arrived, one of the salespeople would then "consult" them, and offer one of the dating packages.
            <br><br>
            One problem we had was the lead quality. <i>"Yaduhhh..."</i>, yes, I heard you.
            <br><br>
            I could bring in ALL the leads, but if they weren't convinced in the first place, it was unlikely the funnel would work. They were likely curious about the process and the experience, not necessarily committed to pay thousands to meet a potential partner. 
            <br><br>
            I worked on the entire Top Of The Funnel, which for the most part meant paid ads on Google and Facebook. I'd create them, test them, and run the winners. I hit our monthly leads target with consistency, though not without obsession and my dreams being invaded. If my dreams aren't being invaded, I know I'm not obessing enough.
            <br><br>
            I heard the same thing each month: <i>"We need <b>more</b> leads"</i> and <i>"We need <b>better</b> leads"</i>.
            <br><br>
            One day I had a breakthrough. I used to tinker with the landing pages during lull periods. I'd create many variations to test. Moving elements around, using different success stories, trying to add more relevancy to the ads.
            <br><br>
            On this occasion, after hearing another round of howling about quality, I changed it up. I did something, now tame, then considered drastic. But hey, I was in charge, the mad scientist with no overseer. I removed the sign up forms from the Top Of The Fold, and kept the ones at the bottom of the pages. I did it for all the live landing pages, which is insane.
            <br><br>
            It worked brilliantly though. At first the complaints about the sudden decrease in leads volume began. I expected this. Then it became a full blown panic. Hysteria ensued. I kept my cool as well as I could, monitoring the numbers on our back office, saying nothing.
            <br><br>
            See, the landing page builder we used had heat mapping, scroll depth analysis, and various other data available. Our amazing proprietary back office (really! internally built, wonderful thing) was a database of detailed information about everyone. 
            <br><br>
            It also had something I often used.
            <br><br>
            It had the last touchpoint "source" of the leads. This was the user journey for me. Technically, I <i>could</i> trace them back to their point of origin, be it an ad or an email, and to pinpoint specific landing pages. So I did. Having downloaded and compiled the list of a mind-numbingly large number of users, I started piecing the aggregated data together. I wasn't 100% sure, but I was young and ready to take chances, <i>and</i> prepared to be wrong.
            <br><br>
            From ad, to landing page, to database, to call centre, to appointment, to closed sale. I manually stitched together as thorough a journey as I could. My hypothesis was that the majority of closed sales, were users who signed up at the bottom of the pages. They were the ones who scrolled. They read the success stories, the "How It Works" section, the CEO message. They were invested. Though I had no way to prove it, they were likely the ones who had the highest time spent on page as well.
            <br><br>
            So it wasn't a random thing, insane possibly, but not random. I calculated the move before removing the Top Of The Fold sign-up form. I anticipated users who weren't even close to being interested would bounce. And bounce they did. Obviously I also anticipated panic-mode from the sales team. I was still confident in the data, and that my hypothesis was correct. The research had been done, I'd been as diligent in my process as I could be, given the tools I had. The last bit required a little courage and patience.
            <br><br>
            It paid off. By the 3rd week, though there were fewer leads, most of the team had exceeded their sales targets. The next month everyone hit their targets by <b>nuts%</b>. Being sales people, they went back to calling old prospects and using the usual tactics. Why not? There was still time to close more. 
            <br><br>
            Still, the fire was lit. It was fun. I even received a pen.
