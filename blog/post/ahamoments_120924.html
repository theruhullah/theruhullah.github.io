          <h2>SIMPLICITY</h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>Ok, so I'll share three of the most memorable and important "aha!" moments in my career, ranked, but not in order.</b>
            <br><br>
            The first is when I first started affiliate marketing. I had made 2 copies of the same site, and was promoting a product aimed at more elderly folk. That'll be a key part later on.
            <br><br>
            I had finished templating the first site with a theme I'd bought, called "Sleek". When I was done, I was exhausted and decided to take a break. I'd end up taking a very long nap, and only got back to work on the second site a few days later.
            <br><br>
            Both the sites were live and had been pre-backlink flooded before I started working on the first one.
            <br><br>
            Both were ranking in the top 3, yet when I checked my backoffice, the one I hadn't worked on was outperforming the "Sleek" one, sales-wise. It was all organic because I wasn't advertising at all. Only SEO. The Sleek one even ranked higher.
            <br><br>
            The one I had barely worked on had basic CSS formatting, creating sections and paragraphs, title text and so on. But nothing else. It was black text on white background (with a tonne of white text keywords spammed at the bottom, of course).
            <br><br>
            For quite a while I wondered why it was so, and didn't worry too much because, results! The other one looked very corporate, and shiny, like a big-pharma site. The content was exactly the same though. Not a single word did I change. That was why I bought the theme, it looked professional <i>after all</i>.
            <br><br>
            I realised it was likely the audience who were ending up on the site <i>-the target audience-</i> found it less sale-sy. There was a person behind there, a "someone", not a "somecompany". Thus it appeared to be more trustworthy. <i>Little did they know...</i>
            <br><br>
            I tested this out with other similar products aimed at the older generation, and it held true. Not always, but reliably enough that I could replicate it with consistency. The reverse was also true, to a lesser degree.
            <br><br>
            It was my first official glipse into understanding your audience, and tailoring your message, aesthetics, and product to appeal to them. These days, we have dynamic customisations, based on various factors, including data shared with the site through your browser or device. It's helpful, and takes some of the guesswork out, although it absolutely doesn't mean foregoing research, or testing hypotheses.
